# animosys_spambot
a bot that snatches slots from puny human mouse clicks for you

This current version of this bot is a WIP.

My friend said this bot could DDoS a server, but I disagree. Your server has to be a massive piece of shit for my spam bot to kill it. Furthermore, I don't intend to share this bot to everyone, so probably only 5 people at most will concurrently spam requests to the server.

## Prerequisites
Get these before using the script:

1. Selenium for Python
2. chromedriver.exe (for your current version of Chrome)
3. A MyLasalle account
4. A cart filled with subjects on your Animosys
